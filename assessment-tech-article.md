# Give Two Employees The Power of Twenty With These Small Business Communications Tips

Let's face it. The notion of communication has forever changed. In only one generation our world has gone from local communities, to a global always-on community. We are still trying to catch up with the cultural implications of this change. But small-businesses who used to only serve a local market and communicate in-person, with letters and phone calls, now face the daunting task of communicating to the entire world, at any time, and in any place. Our market is now Everywhere. Always on. Always connected.

The result? Today, small-businesses find themselves stretched thin and overwhelmed with the always-connected nature of our internet world.

But there's a silver-lining...

Along with these new challenges, a new technology solution for communicating has appeared. It has the power to give even two employees the communication power of twenty.

It's called **UCaaS** (yeesh...another acronym, right?). [Unified Communication as a Service](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/unified-communications/).

UCaaS is just fancy way of saying _cloud-based communications_.

It may sound complicated, but it really isn't. It's actually here to **simplify** your small business communications and take you to the next level.

The pleasant truth is that you've probably already used this technology without even realizing it. Anyone who has ever used Skype, Zoom, Google Voice, or Vonage (to name a few), have already used [VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/small-business-voip-service/), one of the most foundational layers of cloud communications. 

## The Benefits of UCaaS for Your Small Business Communications

The idea of moving to a cloud-based communications system may sound overwhelming at first. But I promise, it really isn't. The payoff for making the switch is massive.

Let's talk about what do you stand to benefit by adopting a cloud-based approach to your communications.

### Cost & Complication Savings
Perhaps the most important benefit of UCaaS is cost savings. In the immortal words of Warren Buffet, "Cash is King".  Purchasing and installing phone lines/equipment, adding extensions, voicemail, automated directories, all require additional costs and someone to set it all up and manage it.

With UCaaS, you can pay a reasonably small fee ($15-$20 per month), and get immediate access to pick and choose whatever communication features you need.

### Mobility
**I can attest to the value of this one**. As an aficionado of coffee houses, I do most of my client meetings and communications while out and about. 

With cloud-communications, you can take your entire small-business communications system on the road with you..._all of it_. That also means you can offer your employees the ability to work from anywhere, with all of the tools they use at their fingertips.

### Hiring & Scalability
Today, the first thing job-searchers do when they search for a job, is filter postings by location; onsite, remote, hybrid. The fact is, [over half of job seekers](https://pro.morningconsult.com/analyst-reports/state-of-workers-2024) are looking for remote or hybrid work. 

With UCaaS, getting your new remote or hybrid worker setup for communications is as easy as point-and-click. That means adding employees, as many as you need, becomes a simple and scalable task.

### Improved Productivity & Collaboration
With all of the many ways that we communicate in our modern world, having a centralized way to engage them all is one of the most important drivers for productivity and collaboration.

Having a unified communication service gives you the ability to equip your employees with a clear and consistent way to collaborate. Rather than piecing together a hodge-podge of communication tools, you can instead have *one* place to do it all: video, chat, messsaging, CMS integration, automated workflows and information sharing.

## Finding The Best Services For Your Small Business (Full UCaaS vs. VoIP,  Messaging, etc.)

The next obvious question is which of the services out there is best to start with? Does it make any difference? Do you have to dive into the deep end, or are there ways that you can ease-into the pool of product features?

Let's talk about some basic steps for choosing the best businesses communication tools for your small business.

### Assess Your Needs

Before you begin looking at all the options available to you, it's best to begin by identifying your specific business communication needs.

Let's take a look at some of the more common features available with UCaaS providers. You can decide if you want them all, or only need one or two options. Here's a list of some of the more common features:
